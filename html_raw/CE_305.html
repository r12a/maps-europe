  <p><span class="date">by 305</span> After numerous invasions and reversals, Diocletian reforms the Roman army and restores most of the borders to something close to those of the previous map.</p>
  <p>Dacia is, however, occupied by the Gothic tribe called the Gepids, while the remaining Goths split into Visigoths in the west, and Ostrogoths in the east. The latter expand eastwards to the Don, eliminating or absorbing the Roxolani.</p>
  <p>The Vandals also split into Siling and Asding camps, and the Burgundians appear on the River Main.</p>
