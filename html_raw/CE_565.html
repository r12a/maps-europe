<p><span class="date">531</span> The Franks annex Thuringia.</p>
<p><span class="date">533</span> Justinian's general Belisarius captures Carthage while the Vandal king is in Sardinia, then defeats the king when he returns.</p>
<p><span class="date">534</span> The Franks subjugate Burgundy.</p>
<p><span class="date">536</span> Surprised by the ease with which they recovered Sicily, Belisarius leads a small army up the peninsula to Rome and lays siege to the city. The Franks take Provence and the central Alps from the Ostrogoths.</p>
<p><span class="date">540</span> The Ostrogothic king surrenders his crown and capital to Belisarius. Belisarius sails home, but the Goths north of the River Po fight back until the Romans are unable to keep much more than Ravenna.</p>
<p><span class="date">552</span> Justinian sends another army with Narses through Dalmatia, where they are joined by 5,000 Lombards. The Mongolian empire of the Jouan-Jouan is defeated by Turkic tribes, and they head westward.</p>
<p><span class="date">553</span>  Narses annihilates the Ostrogoth army between Ravenna and Rome. The Bavarians and Lombards profit from this to expand their territory below the Danube, during which the Bavarians accept a measure of Frankish suzerainty.</p>
<p><span class="date">554</span> A civil war in Iberia gives Justinian an opportunity to seize the south-east part of the Iberian peninsula.</p>
<p><span class="date">557</span> The Turks defeat the White Huns in Transoxiana, and the latter join the remnants of the Jouan-Jouan north of the Caspian, from where the Turks inflict another defeat that sends the further west, where they are known as the Avars.</p>
<p><span class="date">559-561</span> After incitement by Justinian to attach the Huns and Slavs of the Russian steppes, the Avars subjugate all the tribes between the Volga and the Danube.</p>
<p><span class="date">562</span> The Avars attack Thuringia.</p>
